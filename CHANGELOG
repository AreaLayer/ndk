    Obsolete `subject` as a first-class citizen since that's not the case in nostr.

    Implement NIP-27 mentions.

2023-05-03 pablof7z <npub1l2vyh47mk2p0qlsku7hg0vn29faehy9hy34ygaclpn66ukqp3afqutajft>

    Change NDKPool to emit `connect` when the whole pool is connected instead of on a per-relay
    basis. NDKPool now emits `relay:connect` when a single relay connects as well as a
    `relay:disconnect`.

## Caching
NDK provides out-of-the-box database-agnostic caching functionality to improve the
performance of applications.

### Cached items
The most important data to cache is *where* a user or note might be found. UX suffers profoundly when this type of data cannot be found. The nostr protocol leaves beadcrums of where a user or note might be.

```ts
const redisAdapter = new RedisAdapter(redisUrl)
const ndk = new NDK({ cacheAdapter: redisAdapter })
```

## Buffered queries
Clients often need to load data (e.g. profile data) from individual components at
once (e.g. initial page render). This typically causes multiple subscriptions to
be submitted fetching the same information and causing poor performance or getting
rate-limited/maxed out by relays.

NDK implements a convenient subscription model, *buffered queries*, where a named
subscription will be created after a customizable amount of time, so that multiple
components can append queries.

```ts
// Component 1
ndk.bufferedSubscription({ kinds: [0], authors: ['pubkey-1'] }, "profiles", 500);

// Component 2
ndk.bufferedSubscription({ kinds: [0], authors: ['pubkey-2'] }, "profiles", 500);

// after 500ms of the first call, a subscription will be created with filter
// { kinds: [0], authors: [ 'pubkey-1', 'pubkey-2' ]}
```

## Intelligent relay selection
When a client submits a request through NDK, NDK will calculate which relays are
most likely able to satisfy this request.

Queries submitted by the client might be broken into different queries if NDK
computes different relays.

For example, say npub-A follows npub-B and npub-C. If the NDK client uses

```ts
const ndk = new NDK({ explicitRelays: ['wss://nos.lol'] })
const npubA = ndk.getUser('npub-A');
const feedEvents = await npubA.feed();
```

This would result in the following request:

```json
{ "kinds": [1], "authors": [ "npub-B", "npub-C" ] }
```

But if NDK has observed that `npub-B` tends to write to `wss://userb.xyz` and
`npub-C` tends to write to `wss://userc.io`, NDK will send the following queries.

```json
// to npub-A's explicit relay wss://nos.lol *if* npub-B and npub-C have been seen on that relay
{ "kinds": [1], "authors": [ "npub-B", "npub-C" ] }

// to wss://userb.xyz
{ "kinds": [1], "authors": [ "npub-B" ] }

// to wss://userc.io
{ "kinds": [1], "authors": [ "npub-C" ] }
```

## Auto-closing subscriptions
Often clients want to fetch data but they don't necessarily need to occupy a connection
to the relay.

The `autoclose` flag will make the connection close immediately after EOSE is seen.
An integer `autoclose` will close the connection after that amount of ms after EOSE is seen.

```ts
ndk.subscription({kinds:[0], authors:['...']}, { autoclose: true })
```

## Convenience classes

```ts
const ndk = new NDK({ explicitRelays, privateKey });
const pablo = ndk.getProfile('npub1l2vyh47mk2p0qlsku7hg0vn29faehy9hy34ygaclpn66ukqp3afqutajft')
```

### Convenience classes provide access to construct events
```ts
const pablo = await ndk.getProfile('npub1l2vyh47mk2p0qlsku7hg0vn29faehy9hy34ygaclpn66ukqp3afqutajft')
pablo.name = 'Pablo';
await pablo.publish(); // autosigns
```

### Creating events
```ts
const ndk = new NDK({ explicitRelays, signer })
const event = new NDKEvent()
event.kind = 1;
event.content = "This is cool, I'm going to autotag @jack@cashapp.com"
await ndk.publish(event)
```

### Liking someone's event
```ts
const event = await ndk.events({ author: 'jack@cashapp.com' })[0]
await event.react('ðŸ¤™') // signs and publishes
```

* Provides access to see status

### Signing Events via NIP-46
```ts
const signingAdapter = new NDK.RemoteSignerAdapter()
const ndk = new NDK({ signingAdapter })
const event = ndk.event()
event.kind = 0;
event.content = "This event is signed via NIP-46."
await event.publish()
```


```ts
const zap =
```

# Architecture
Users of NDK should instantiate a single NDK instance.

That instance tracks state with all relays connected, explicit and otherwise.

All relays are tracked in a single pool that handles connection errors/reconnection logic.

RelaySets are assembled ad-hoc as needed depending on the queries set, although some RelaySets might be long-lasting, like the `explicitRelays` specified by the user.

RelaySets are always a subset of the pool of all available relays.
